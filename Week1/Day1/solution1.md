**Question:**
Analyze the behavior of the given function `fun(w, x)` which includes a condition based on modulo operations. The function is called as `fun(40, 4)`. Provide a **descriptive solution in pseudocode format**, and explain the **final output**.

---

**Descriptive Solution (in Pseudocode):**

```
Function fun(w, x):
    Set y = 0
    
    IF (x mod w == 0) OR (w mod x == 0):
        Increment y by 1
    ELSE:
        Increment y by 10

    Print the value of y

Call fun(40, 4)
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation for Input (40, 4):**

* Input values: `w = 40`, `x = 4`
* `x % w` → `4 % 40` = 4 → NOT equal to 0
* `w % x` → `40 % 4` = 0 → IS equal to 0
* The condition: `(x % w == 0) or (w % x == 0)` → evaluates to **True**
* So, the `if` block is executed:

  * `y = y + 1` → `y = 0 + 1` → `y = 1`
* The value of `y` is printed → Output: **1**

**Final Answer with Input (40, 4):**

```
Output: 1
```
