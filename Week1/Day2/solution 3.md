Let's analyze and solve the given Python code step by step.

### Code:

```python
def fun(a, b):
    if (a and b and (a + b) > 0):
        return a + fun(a - 2, b - 2) + b
    return a ^ b

res = fun(8, 8)
print(res)
```

---

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

We are given: `res = fun(8, 8)`

#### Recursive Call Expansion:

Let’s trace `fun(8, 8)`:

#### First call:

```
fun(8, 8)
→ since (8 and 8 and 16 > 0) is True,
→ return 8 + fun(6, 6) + 8
```

#### Second call:

```
fun(6, 6)
→ return 6 + fun(4, 4) + 6
```

#### Third call:

```
fun(4, 4)
→ return 4 + fun(2, 2) + 4
```

#### Fourth call:

```
fun(2, 2)
→ return 2 + fun(0, 0) + 2
```

#### Fifth call:

```
fun(0, 0)
→ since a and b are both 0 → condition fails
→ return 0 ^ 0 = 0
```

---

### Now backtrack:

* fun(0,0) = `0`
* fun(2,2) = `2 + 0 + 2 = 4`
* fun(4,4) = `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
* fun(6,6) = `6 + 12 + 6 = 24`
* fun(8,8) = `8 + 24 + 8 = 40`

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

```
40
```

The output `40` is correct.
